<p>So after one too many beers, I volunteered to give a 20-minute lightning speech on areas of interest, and some interesting tools I've learned since finishing university. </p>

<div id="roadmap">
	So I'm not 100% sure about this. This is just my first thoughts on the subject. My intention is to do a quick demo using impress.js. I also need to make it clear that this is an open session. These 20-40 minutes aren't me saying things, but I'm also trying to pull experiences from the audience. That's the most important thing. 

The following are skills, and places where you can learn them:
<ul>
<li>SQL: almost all gis data follows a database model. Knowing how to manipulate databases will ensure that you're not locked into expensive extensions and tools</li>
<li>Python: This is the platform that's ideal for automation of tasks. It is the easiest language to learn (get the xkcd comic) and it has a robust ecosystem</li>
<li>Some web: In the era of mass-communication, the message is king. Being able to add flair to the message takes things to the next level</li>
<li>Cartography: You've all been taught about projections. You've forgotten a lot of it. Chances are most of you haven't had the time with the design portions of carto: Typography, linewidths, etc. This is something that takes time. </li>
</ul>

There's also the tools I've learned to love:
<ul>
<li>Mapbox - make beautiful webmaps. </li>
<li>PostGIS - everyone keeps telling me to learn this one. nuts. </li>
<li>QGIS - not every map or analysis requires a Arc License </li>
<li>GDAL - Tricky to learn, exponential payoff</li>
</ul>


Finally, this presentation lists the resources I've found so far. Even the silly ones.
