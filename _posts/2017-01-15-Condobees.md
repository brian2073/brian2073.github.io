<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">M</span>y first commerial project. A combination of many factors taken under mentorship with David Krett (link).</p>

This project had me work in the following areas:

  1. Front-end development with VueJS, Including Router and Resource.
  2. Back-end development. Create controllers, connect them up. 
  3. Mapping. Markers, styles and data-driven popups using Mapbox GL
  4. Javascript and ES6 Interaction
  5. PostGIS. 

This was my first crack at Rails and VueJS, and needs a significant design overhaul. I feel that the UI is decent, but there are elements that could stand to be so much better. Since then, I've learned how to carry out e2e testing using selenium, as well as creating better tests in Minispec, RSpec (my preferred choice), and Mocha.
