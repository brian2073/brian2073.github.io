Mapping a large worksite is an important, but overlooked task for project managers. Often many sites are poorly mapped, if at all. This results in time lost for individuals who can't find the way. 

This is an example of a map in Northern Alberta which I userd to help people find the way, and find context in the presence of many moving parts.
