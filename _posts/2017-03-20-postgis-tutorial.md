Hi everyone!

I'm a ESRI user who is also a junior web developer on the Node stack, and has figured out how to use QGIS on a Macbook Pro. This means that QGIS is the only GIS software which I'll likely use in the near future. This means I'll need to learn it which means I'm in a good position to write about it from the experience of someone who just made those struggles. 

_So this is where I ask you:_

- Is there something you really want to know more about with QGIS from design to databases?
- Is there a technical problem or configuration issue?
- Are you just not sure how to install it?

Write a comment, tweet me at [@brian_bancroft](http://twitter.com/brian_bancroft), or just [email me](mailto:hello@brianbancroft.ca). I'd love to learn this and share what I've learned.

Because I work full-time, expect a slow trickle of posts. Two a month, really. 

Thanks to all who offer suggestions or critique. When you complain about something you don't understand, this allows me to focus my language or instruction to broaden the users who can benefit from my word. By speaking, you are helping me out just as much as venting your frustration. Thanks!

 My next tutorial will be likely a Youtube video or step-by-step video on installing QGIS on a Macbook Pro thanks to a suggestion by [@HarelDan](http://twitter.com/HarelDan).
