# LETS LEARN NEW THINGS

So I know a few things. Maybe you want to learn a few things as well? These are all my suggestions on things worth learning.

## Development
- Git is an open-source tool that allows people to seamlessly collaborate and exchange information and ideas in a controlled setting. Learning how to use this tool will take you far in this world.

- Codecademy is a really easy way to understand the syntax of various languages. It won't take you to professional-grade, nor will it help you get to the point where you can search your way through Stackoverflow for the solutions to your problems, but this is still a very good first step.

- RubyMonk is an old way of teaching Ruby, and works as another tool beside Codecademy.

- In order to be solid with programming, you need to understand *loops*. This is one place to learn.

- In order to be solid with programming, you also need to have a grasp on logic. *Khan Academy* has a free curriculum to offer to everyone as well!

## Mapping
- Mapbox is my favorite tool for webmapping. I recommend you learn it if you've ever used the Google Maps API as it has much more functionality available to the common user.

## Design
- Typography is something that can set apart maps, web pages and the like.

## Science Fiction and Blogging
- Jerry Pournelle is one of my favorite authours. If you want the reasoned arguments of someone you don't agree with, this is where you go. Not only does he understand the science behind the topic of the day, his letter-writers also understand the problem as well.
