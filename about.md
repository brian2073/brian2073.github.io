*I've been around the block.*

I'm currently employed as a developer around the GTA. Prior to that, I've been a soldier, a mapper, and a technician all across the world.

I have a passion for mapping and the outdoors, and my long term goals are to work, and live confortably back somewhere in Vancouver Island. For now, I learn as I work.

I hold an honours bachelor of science with majors in Physics and Geomatics. My ambitions are to better understand server-driven processes and javascript-based toolchains. After that, I intend to get into data science. My stack is mainly Ruby and Javascript. I use Node, Ember, Vue, Express and a little bit of React. I've carried out some automated testing in Selenium with WebdriverIO, and Mocha. I've also tested in RSpec.

I'm happily employed at [CareerJSM](https://careerjsm.com/), but I'm always looking for small challenges on the weekends.
