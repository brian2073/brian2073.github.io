#GO GEOMATICS 21

##Or, where I learned to stop worrying and receive ESRI Cert.


**Goal:** to discuss my process with the test. Ideal end-state is that people know where to go and what to do on conclusion

##Learning Objectives/Gameplan

1. Overview of ESRI certification ttypes and other software companies that do this.
   * Deeper overview onto Desktop certification.
2. Registration: how to, and how easy is it?
3. Study strategies, what is out there?  
  - courses by third parties
  - courses by ESRI
  - the book
  - other books
  - going straight from the website.
4. How I hacked it.
5. Questions

##Time: 15min max, then time for questions.

##Teaching plan:
###Part 1: overview
What is it: explain the certifications, and what's out there
why do we care: it's a baseline metric that ESRI has thrown out, and it is harder to cheat than every other course or online crse. You can't lie about having this without being caught.

###Part 2: registration
Task: create screencast-o-matic play by play that goes through the process

###Part 3: study strategies
1. Show that the website itself has the required resources and where to get them
2. Show two examples of third-party partners who teach this stuff, and their rates
3. Show that ESRI also teaches this
4. Show the book. Explain its composition

###Part 4: how I hacked it
Task - Explain my general process in a nutshell.

##Lesson Plan:

###Introduction and overview

Hi there, my name is Brian, and I'm here to talk for 15 about my process with the ESRI Desktop Associate certification.

If you're a regular, you're probably here mainly to meet cool people. So I'll keep this talk short as possible, and leave the rest to questions. If you're coming for this talk..? I'll show you how to register for a test (It's not that hard), ways you can study, and what you can get out of this test.

####Slide: Why the ESRI Certification program

I'll go further into this for my third article. I can see that ESRI does this for a couple of reasons. First, it creates a baseline that proves competency with its platform that is not something that people can easily muck their way through.

My assumption was that you'd need an 80% grade to pass. This is not actually the case, and ESRI won't disclose what the passing grade actually is.



###Slide: Registration
Okay, registration is an easy part of the whole thing. I've embedded a video in this slide that shows the process of me registering for an exam.

###Slide: Study Strategies - title
Alright, the time has come to talk about the particular study strategies I've employed for this examination. Here, I'm going to talk about where to identify the topics you need to cover, and the ways you can study for them.

###Slide: Obtaining a checklist
(Picture: where to find the checklist)
If you want to play to win, this is the checklist that you really want to pay attention to. Once you've crossed off each and every item off of that list, you will be good to go.


###Slide: Method 1: Looking through the help files.
If you are self-driven, this is the way you want to do things, and this is the way you will attain success. Go through your items on your checklist, line-by-line, and find the associated topics. Know those topics. If flash cards are your thing, build a flashcard repository on them. If you aren't hot on the topic at hand, additional resources exist for free, or at cost, to help you on your way.

###Slide: Some of these resources:
 * The ArcGIS Tutorials that came with your distribution.
 * Lynda and Youtube. If you hate reading, there are tutorial videos that are up that can help you on those topics. Unlike the other major software suites, there isn't enough generated on Lynda to justify a subscription. Lucky for you, you can watch these videos at no cost through your Toronto library card. Just google "Lynda Toronto Library"

 * At cost, but decently-priced: The ESRI Self-Paced lecture courses. If you're serious about improving your skill with ArcGIS on your own time, these courses are solid bang for your buck, and I would recommend them especially for their series of curated exercises.

###Slide: Method 2: Third-party courses and ESRI.
This is an option that exists, but I don't know many people who have taken it. These are full-on courses that are designed to bring intermediate users up to speed on taking the ESRI Desktop Associate exam. The costs of these courses lie somewhere in the mid to high hundred dollar range (USD), and last 1-2 days. Two companies that I know off the top of my head that offer these courses are egis associates, and Geospatial Training Services. These courses can vary between classroom, or live-online.

I talked with the head of egis, and that operation is also willing to send a trainer out for employers who have multiple people interested in taking the course and they do bulk rates.

ESRI also offers one of these online-live courses as well. It's over 1k USD, and I haven't heard of the best returns from those who rely exclusively by this method.

###Slide: Method 3: The book
(photo: My book an desk)
This is a dry, but well-written book. It is chock-full of exercises which differ from the tutotials offered, and I've used this book to write the 10.3 exam for Associate. ESRI describes this book as "comprehensive" and at a 70$ price point, it's accessible considering the 250 price point for the exam.

###Slide: How I got ready.

  1. Book First
  2. Checklist second. It was easy to go through the checklist once I had the book under my belt.
  3. Question bank on the self-paced courses offered by ESRI. Doing this helped me confirm that I was ready to tackle this beast.


###Slide: Finally, experience is a must.
ESRI recommends having at least two years of experience with the platform before you tackle this beast, and I agree. Almost every time I was absolutely sure of a question, it was thanks to the outcome of a task or challenge I carried out in the workplace, or on my own, that drew experience related to the topic in question.


###Slide: Finally, on going to the exam.
For this, I can't go into too many details. You have to sign an NDA where I promise not to tell you what the questions are.

What I will say is the following:
1. ESRI offered no surprises. Each question was a topic said on that list, or a subset of.
2. Dont' worry about bringing a pen or pencil. Everything is digital right down to the signature.
3. Bring a copy of your confirmation with you and a phone. I went in on the weekend, and I found that the office building was locked from the outside. I had to call the number on the reservation slip to get in.
4. You will likely meet other people who are carrying out exams on different topics. The Pearson operation that ESRI has bought into supports many types of examinations.

When carrying out the questions, I answered the ones I knew, marked the ones I didnt'. I then went through the list a second, and third time with the time I had to spare. Don't rush. It's not needed. Don't panic.

###Slide: Afterwards.
So when I finished the exam, I got a confirmation, then an email a few days that offered me to see the results.
